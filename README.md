# Python-Project_Acoustic-Modeling
Project Background:

Build a comprehensive interactive data analysis and modeling platform that enables users to seamlessly import, clean, visualize, analyze, and model data using scientific calculations and data visualization tools. The platform will tackle the problem of voice intelligibility in enclosed spaces that can be disruptive to hearing and learning. 

Application utilizes a graphical user interface (based on tkinter) to:

Import data:
Load data file from various sources


Clean: Provide data cleaning tools to handle missing values, remove metadata, and inconsistencies in channel format. Detect and correct data formatting issues, such mp3 to wav format conversion

Data Analysis: Generate summary statistics and descriptive measures such as length of audio sample and RT60 value. Create data visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, or bar charts. Visualize the original waveform. Identify patterns or trends in the data, specifically RT60 values over three frequency ranges.

Data modeling: Visualize model performance and interpret results (all plots part of GUI). Visualize RT60 data for each frequency range and overlapping. Display the greatest resonant frequency (greatest value). 

Reporting: Identify the difference in RT60 time to reduce RT60 to maximum voice intelligibility of 0.5 seconds.
